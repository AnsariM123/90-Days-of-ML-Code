#### Welcome to **90 Days of Machine Learning Code** â€” a daily, hands-on, beginner-to-advanced roadmap designed to help you build real-world ML skills, one day at a time.

##### Whether you're a student, developer, or content creator, this challenge will turn your curiosity into capability. From data preprocessing to deep learning and NLP with Transformers, you'll write code, complete projects, and learn the tools that power the future â€” in just 90 days.

##### ðŸ’¡ Why This Challenge?
Because machine learning is not just the future â€” it's the now.
And the best way to learn it is by doing.

##### This isn't just another course â€” it's a movement.
A commitment.
A path that turns you into the engineer, creator, or thinker you aspire to be.


##### ðŸš€ What You'll Do
Master essential ML concepts step-by-step
Build 10+ real-world projects
Work with cutting-edge tools (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face)
Deploy your models to the web
Create a GitHub portfolio to showcase your work
And most importantly... never code alone

##### ðŸ§  Who This is For
Beginners starting their ML journey
Developers leveling up their skills
Creators building content around data
Anyone who believes in learning by doing

"The future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways." â€“ Robert Greene
